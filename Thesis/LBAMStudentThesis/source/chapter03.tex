\chapter{Theory and methodology}%
As mentioned in previous sections, forming a virtual experiment platform 
is necessary for investigation of the temperature estimation algorithm. 


So, we are going to build a numerical experiment platform

we have a temperature, and how is the platform built, which input and 
output do we have.
