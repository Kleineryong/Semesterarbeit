\chapter{Theory and methodology}%
As mentioned in previous sections, forming a virtual experiment platform 
is necessary for investigating the temperature estimation algorithm. So, a virtual 
experiment platform is developed based on Planks'law, then, a virtual multi-spectral 
pyrometer is applied to obtain the digital value (also called image). 


\section{Physical value of radiation}%
Radiation is emitted from any object with a temperature above $0 \text{K}$. In equation \ref{eq: radiation_pv}
can be found, that the radiation depends on the black body radiation $B(\lambda, T)$ 
and emissivity $\varepsilon(\lambda, T)$. Both value are temperature $T$ and wavelength $\lambda$ 
dependent.

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq: radiation_pv}
    L(\lambda, T) = B(\lambda, T) \cdot \varepsilon (\lambda, T)
\end{equation}

%
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq: planks_law}
    B(\lambda, T) = \frac{{2hc^2}}{{\lambda^5}} \cdot {\left[{\exp\left(\frac{{hc}}{{\lambda k_B T}}\right) - 1}\right]}^{-1}
\end{equation}
