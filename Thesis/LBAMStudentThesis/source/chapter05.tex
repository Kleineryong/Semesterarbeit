\chapter{Calcualtion results and analysis}
Once all the experiment data and parameters are determined, the results 
of the calculation should be presented and analyzed. Thus, the 
accuracy, consistency, pros and cons of the virtual experiment 
platform and temperature estimation algorithm can be systematically 
analyzed.

\section{Calculation results}
how the emissivity was visualized


how does the compare program works

\subsection{Temperature field}
calculated temperature field
\subsection{Emissivity field}
calculated emissivity field
\section{Data analysis}
use statistical method to analyse the calculated result
\subsection{Sensitivity analysis of emissivity models}
how different emissivity model affect the performance 
\subsection{Performance between different materials}
how is the performance between different materials.
