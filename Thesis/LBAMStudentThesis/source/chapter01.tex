\chapter{Introduction}%

\gls{am} is a different type of processing technology to conventional 
manufacturing methods. Instead of removing material from the raw part, 
additive manufactoring is usually described as "a process of joining materials
to make objects layer by layer or element by element"\cite{Frazier.2014}.
It is a useful method for reducing the the duration from product design 
to product manufacturing and imporving the material 
utilization\cite{Swift.2013b}. 


There are several \gls{am} technologies that can produce different raw materials 
such as metal and plastic.
