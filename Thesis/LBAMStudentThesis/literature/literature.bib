 abstract = {A contactless temperature measurement system is presented based on a hyperspectral line camera that captures the spectra in the visible and near infrared (VNIR) region of a large set of closely spaced points. The measured spectra are used in a nonlinear least squares optimization routine to calculate a one-dimensional temperature profile with high spatial resolution. Measurements of a liquid melt pool of AISI 316L stainless steel show that the system is able to determine the absolute temperatures with an accuracy of 10{\%}. The measurements are made with a spatial resolution of 12 µm/pixel, justifying its use in applications where high temperature measurements with high spatial detail are desired, such as in the laser material processing and additive manufacturing fields.},

@article{Frazier.2014,
 abstract = {This paper reviews the state-of-the-art of an important, rapidly emerging, manufacturing technology that is alternatively called additive manufacturing (AM), direct digital manufacturing, free form fabrication, or 3D printing, etc. A broad contextual overview of metallic AM is provided. AM has the potential to revolutionize the global parts manufacturing and logistics landscape. It enables distributed manufacturing and the productions of parts-on-demand while offering the potential to reduce cost, energy consumption, and carbon footprint. This paper explores the material science, processes, and business consideration associated with achieving these performance gains. It is concluded that a paradigm shift is required in order to fully exploit AM potential.},

Contact-free thermal imaging-based measurement approaches thus appear to be particularly suitable for process monitoring. With the potential to generate vast amounts of accurate data in real time and combined with artificial intelligence methods to enable real-time analysis and integration of expert knowledge, thermal spectral imaging is identified as a promising method offering more robust and accurate identification of key parameters, such as surface temperature, morphology, composition, and flow rate.},

 abstract = {A lot of strategies exist to monitor and control additive layer manufacturing processes. Basically one can distinguish between coaxially monitoring the process zone and monitoring the complete layer currently being built. Since Selective Laser Melting is a thermal process, a lot of information about the process and in consequence about the resulting part quality can be gathered by monitoring the temperature distribution of a complete layer and its temporal evolution. It depends on the geometrical configuration of parts being built and the quality of the powder layer deposition. In this paper, process errors originating from insufficient heat dissipation are investigated as well as the limits for detecting pores and other irregularities by observation of the temperature distribution.},

In AM based on metals, the temperature field of melting pool has critical impacts on phase transformation and mechanical properties. Researchers have developed various approaches to track real-time temperature during ultrahigh temperature in AM. Nevertheless, large temperature gradient around the energy source demands a capable measurement system and method due to the limitations of the conventional infrared cameras and pyrometers. This study will explore the deficiency and improvement of the existing approaches with a focus on the cutting-edge methods of AM process temperature measurement, along with a critical thinking about the follow-up usage of the collected data. Specifically, it will report the status and trends in employing various machine learning and advanced control techniques with the in-situ sensor data for process qualification purposes.},

@article{Pixner.2021,
 abstract = {The complex thermal cycles and temperature distributions observed in additive manufacturing (AM) are of particular interest as these define the microstructure and the associated properties of the part being built. Due to the intrinsic, layer-by-layer material stacking performed, contact methods to measure temperature are not suitable, and contactless methods need to be considered. Contactless infrared irradiation techniques were applied by carrying out thermal imaging and point measurement methods using pyrometers to determine the spatial and temporal temperature distribution in wire-based electron beam AM. Due to the vacuum, additional challenges such as element evaporation must be overcome and additional shielding measures were taken to avoid interference with the contactless techniques. The emissivities were calibrated by thermocouple readings and geometric boundary conditions. Thermal cycles and temperature profiles were recorded during deposition; the temperature gradients are described and the associated temperature transients are derived. In the temperature range of the \textgreek{a}+\textgreek{b} field, the cooling rates fall within the range of 180 to 350 °C/s, and the microstructural characterisation indicates an associated expected transformation of \textgreek{b}$\rightarrow$\textgreek{a}'+\textgreek{a} with corresponding cooling rates. Fine acicular \textgreek{a} and \textgreek{a}' formed and local misorientation was observed within \textgreek{a} as a result of the temperature gradient and the formation of the \textgreek{a}'.},

 abstract = {Powder-based electron beam additive manufacturing (EBAM) has gained increased usage in different industries. Process monitoring such as temperatures may offer important information. However, temperature measurements in EBAM are challenging because of high temperature ranges, extreme gradients and fast transient response. In this study, temperature measurements during the EBAM process, in particular, around the electron beam scanning area, were attempted using a near-infrared thermal camera. The obtained temperature data demonstrated the feasibility of such a measuring technique. The thermal camera was able to capture the pre-heating, contour melting, and hatch melting events. Further, the achievable spatial resolution is around 12 µm when using a 350 mm lens.},

The emissivity model that minimizes the coefficient of dispersion is selected. Accuracy and precision are quantified for the case of known emissivity. It is shown that, at least in the case where wavelengths are linearly distributed, the method is accurate, the precision increases with the total number of wavelengths, and it is maximized if the ratio of the minimum to maximum wavelength is equal to 2.46.

For all three metals, the emissivities of the liquid phases are slightly larger than those of the solid phases both in the visible and near-infrared regions. For iron, the near-infrared emissivities decreased progressively with each additional measurement series and settled down after three series. A possible explanation to this behavior is offered. The present results for iron were assessed by comparisons with previously reported results and with predictions based upon the Hagen--Rubens relation for the ratio of the emissivity of the liquid to that of the solid (\textgreek{e} Liquid/\textgreek{e} Solid). The measured emissivities for all three metals are in good agreement with previous results at and near the melting point. The results for \textgreek{e} Liquid/\textgreek{e} Solid in the near-infrared region demonstrate that the phase (liquid/solid) dependence of the infrared emissivity is consistent with that of the dc resistivity for all the metals at their melting points.},
